## 📊 Project Overview
A data analysis project that transforms and analyzes sales data using SQL and Python (Pandas) to derive actionable business insights for improving sales performance.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project aims to:
- Transform raw sales data from SQL database into analyzable formats
- Identify key sales performance metrics and trends
- Generate actionable insights for business improvement
- Provide data-driven recommendations for sales optimization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- SQL (Data extraction and initial processing)
- Python
  - Pandas (Data transformation and analysis)
  - [Pyodbc]
  - [Numpy]
  - [OS]
- [MATPLOT, Seaborn]

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- SQL Database (specify which one: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Required Python packages:
- Pandas (Data transformation and analysis)
  - [Pyodbc]
  - [Numpy]
  - [OS]
  - [MATPLOT,Seaborn]

  ```

## 📈 Analysis Workflow
1. Data Extraction from SQL Database
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation into CSV file
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Performance Metrics Calculation
5. Insights Generation
6. Visualization and Reporting

## 🔍 Key Findings
[Countries with the highest order value had the least amount of stores, other than the United States]
